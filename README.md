# MedRides

MedRides is a personal web application I developed to provide convenient and reliable transportation for medical appointments. As someone who understands the challenges of getting to medical appointments, I wanted to create a solution that simplifies the process and reduces the stress associated with arranging transportation.

With MedRides, you have access to a user-friendly interface that makes requesting rides for medical appointments a breeze. Whether you have a doctor's appointment, therapy session, or any other medical visit, MedRides allows you to easily input your pickup location, destination, date, and time of the appointment. You can even select the appropriate vehicle type that suits your specific needs.

One of the key features of MedRides is the ability to track the status of your ride requests. You can conveniently view your pending and approved appointments, providing you with transparency and peace of mind. Additionally, MedRides offers a map view that displays the pickup and drop-off locations, helping you visualize the route and make any necessary arrangements.

To further assist you in planning your appointments, MedRides provides estimated duration and time for your rides. This information empowers you to manage your schedule effectively and ensures that you arrive at your destination on time.
